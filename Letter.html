          Artistic Inspirations
        </h2>
        <p>
          It's great to hear about your interest in the historical influences on modern art. Here are some of my favorite movements and their impact:
        </p>
        <p>
          Impressionism
        </p>
        <p style="margin-left: 20px;">
          Characterized by small, thin brush strokes and emphasis on accurate depiction of light. It has profoundly influenced the approach to outdoor painting.
        </p>
        <p>
          Abstract Expressionism
        </p>
        <p style="margin-left: 20px;">
          This movement has led to the exploration of non-representational forms and had a significant impact on contemporary art's freedom of expression.
        </p>
        <p>
          Pop Art
        </p>
        <p style="margin-left: 20px;">
          A pivotal movement that blurred the boundaries between 'high' art and popular culture, leading to innovative use of imagery from mass culture.
